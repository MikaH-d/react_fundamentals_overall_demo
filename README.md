## 🎯 Overview

This React application demonstrates fundamental concepts through interactive examples organized into different sections. Each section focuses on specific React features with practical implementations that showcase real-world usage patterns.

## 🎪 Demo Sections

### 1. **Components Demo** (`/components-demo`)
Learn about React components and props with practical examples:
- **Single Prop Message**: Simple component receiving one prop
- **Multiple Props Welcome**: Component handling multiple props
- **Greeting Components**: Reusable greeting components
- **Footer Example**: Component composition patterns

### 2. **Events Demo** (`/events-demo`)
Explore React event handling mechanisms:
- **Event Demo 1**: Basic click events and event handlers
- **Event Demo 2**: Form events and input handling
- **Event Demo 3**: Advanced event patterns
- **Form Demo**: Complete form handling with validation

### 3. **States Demo** (`/states-demo`)
Understanding React state management:
- **Toggle Visibility**: Show/hide components with state
- **Character Counter**: Real-time input character counting
- **When Variables Fail**: Demonstrating why state is needed

### 4. **useEffect Demo** (`/useEffect-demo`)
Master the useEffect hook:
- **Basic Count Example**: useEffect with state updates
- **Fetching Data**: API calls and data fetching patterns
- **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of effects and subscriptions

### 5. **Conditional Rendering Demo** (`/conditionalRendering-demo`)
Learn different ways to conditionally render components:
- **Ternary Operator**: Using ternary operators for conditional rendering
- **Logical AND**: Using && operator for conditional display
- **If Statements**: Traditional if statement approaches
- **Switch Statements**: Switch case conditional rendering
