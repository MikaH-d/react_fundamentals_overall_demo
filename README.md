## 🎯 Overview

This React application demonstrates fundamental concepts through interactive examples organized into different sections. Each section focuses on specific React features with practical implementations that showcase real-world usage patterns.

## 🎪 Demo Sections

### 1. **Components Demo** (`/components-demo`)
Learn about React components and props with practical examples:
- **Single Prop Message**: Simple component receiving one prop
- **Multiple Props Welcome**: Component handling multiple props
- **Greeting Components**: Reusable greeting components
- **Footer Example**: Component composition patterns

### 2. **Events Demo** (`/events-demo`)
Explore React event handling mechanisms:
- **Event Demo 1**: Basic click events and event handlers
- **Event Demo 2**: Form events and input handling
- **Event Demo 3**: Advanced event patterns
- **Form Demo**: Complete form handling with validation

### 3. **States Demo** (`/states-demo`)
Understanding React state management:
- **Toggle Visibility**: Show/hide components with state
- **Character Counter**: Real-time input character counting
- **When Variables Fail**: Demonstrating why state is needed
- **When Corrected**: Proper state implementation

### 4. **useEffect Demo** (`/useEffect-demo`)
Master the useEffect hook:
- **Basic Count Example**: useEffect with state updates
- **Fetching Data**: API calls and data fetching patterns
- **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of effects and subscriptions

### 5. **Conditional Rendering Demo** (`/conditionalRendering-demo`)
Learn different ways to conditionally render components:
- **Ternary Operator**: Using ternary operators for conditional rendering
- **Logical AND**: Using && operator for conditional display
- **If Statements**: Traditional if statement approaches
- **Switch Statements**: Switch case conditional rendering

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **React 19.1.1** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **React Router DOM 6.28.0** - Declarative routing for React applications
- **React Scripts 5.0.1** - Configuration and scripts for React development
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Modern JavaScript features
- **CSS3** - Styling and responsive design
- **GitHub Pages** - Deployment platform

## 🔄 Updating the Live Demo

The live demo is automatically deployed from the `gh-pages` branch, not directly from the `main` branch. To update the live website with your latest changes:

### **How It Works:**
- **Main Branch**: Contains your source code and development files
- **gh-pages Branch**: Contains only the built production files that GitHub Pages serves
- **Live Website**: Updates only when the `gh-pages` branch is updated

### **To Update the Live Demo:**

1. **Make your changes** in the `main` branch (code, styling, content, etc.)
2. **Commit and push** your changes to the `main` branch
3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### **What happens when you deploy:**
- ✅ Builds your app from the current `main` branch
- ✅ Takes the optimized files from the `build` folder
- ✅ Pushes them to the `gh-pages` branch (overwrites previous version)
- ✅ GitHub Pages automatically updates the live site within a few minutes

### **Important Notes:**
- The live website does **NOT** automatically update when you push to `main`
- You **must** run `npm run deploy` to trigger an update to the live demo
- Changes will be visible at `https://MikaH-d.github.io/react_fundamentals_overall_demo/` after deployment
